Unfortunately linkedin hasn't API for working with comments.

This script downloads comments from linkedin, saves data to data.pickle file,
if file already exists it just append new data but remome all dublicates, data is
always sorted by time of comment had posted.


INSTALL
1) copy files to any directory
2) install python 2.7 and set environment variables
  this is the manual https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html
3) all requirements in requirements.txt, just run pip install -r requirements.txt
4) python load_comments.py <activity> --loggin=<login> --pass=<password> for loading data
5) if something went wrong you could load data from the last loaded part, not from the beginning
6) to create docs run load_comments.py
